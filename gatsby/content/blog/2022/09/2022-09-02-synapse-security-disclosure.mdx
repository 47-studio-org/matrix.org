Hi all,

This week we are disclosing the details of a vulnerability that we have
addressed in [Synapse 1.62.0]
(https://matrix.org/blog/2022/07/06/synapse-1-62-released). Administrators of
homeservers running a Synapse version below 1.62.0 with federation enabled
are advised to update to Synapse 1.62.0 or higher.

Synapse versions prior to 1.62.0 did not correctly implement Matrix's
[event authorization rules]
(https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/rooms/v10/#authorization-rules), meaning an
attacker could craft events that are not compliant with the Matrix
specification but would still be accepted by Synapse. In rooms involving both
homeservers running a vulnerable version of Synapse and homeservers running a
spec-compliant implementation, this could result in divergence in the room's
state between servers.

Please see GitHub security advisory [GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765]
(https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765)
or [CVE-2022-31152]
(https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-31152) for more information.
